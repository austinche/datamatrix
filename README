Scantelope facilitates decoding of data matrix-labeled test tubes.
It supports a few scanners including the Avision AVA6 Plus.

  serv.py                     Main application - uses http API (described below)

  10-saned.rules              udev rules file for Avision scanner to allow 
                   running the software as any user in the 'scanner' group     

INSTALLATION:
(quick guide)
  0) install all dependencies
  1) install sane drivers
  2) set up permissions as per 10-saned.rules 
test with 'scanimage -L'
  3) run 'python serv.py' (or test.py for test)
  4) browse to http://localhost:2233/scan/status


INTERFACE:
(http API)
    http://localhost:2233{command}

replace {command} with:       in order to:
      /                        view CSV of most-recently decoded 
      /scan/list               list available scanners
      /scan/status             show current settings and recent log messages
      /scan/select/{0,1...n}   select scanner from list ( default 0 )
      /scan/setres/{600|300}   select resolution  (default 600 )
      /images/n_m.jpg          view image from row n (0-7) column m (0-11)

The scanning should start on first http access, and will stop automatically 


SUPPORTED SCANNERS:

Scantelope will not work with just any scanner. Since the label of a matrix 
tube generally sits above the surface of the flatbed, it requires a scanner
with a large depth-of-field to work properly.

For this reason, we recommend the Avision AVA6 Plus and have included the 
binary sane drivers as well as a schematic describing the jig we use to 
position the rack on the bed. You can build your own, but may need to tweak
the values in the CONFIG class of the scan.py module. 

There is also limited support for the hp3900 which we do not intend to 
expand at this time.
